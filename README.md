# Bee PHG
Testing an idea related to [VSH](https://www.ars.usda.gov/southeast-area/baton-rouge-la/honeybeelab/docs/varroa-sensitive-hygiene-vsh/) - work in progress

Currently focused on using all available genomes on NCBI to build the PHG and [BioProject PRJNA605407](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA605407) short reads for imputation.

        > CSS scores improve the power to detect and resolve selection signals and localize candidate regions involved in traits experiencing selection pressure. Regions under selection shared by Minnesota Hygienic, Pol-line, Hilo, and Russian stocks provide actionable targets for future research and breeding. Our annotation using haplotype blocks identified 46 of the 58,333 [23] that were shared among the four stocks with a strong signal of selection providing evidence of a common selection signal among stocks associated with mite- and disease-resistance traits. However, there remains an unlikely possibility that a CSS signal may arise of a specific region that is highly selected in only the Italian stocks and not of the other populations. Though we feel that it is more likely that the research stocks are arriving at a shared resistance given the intent of their respective programs.
